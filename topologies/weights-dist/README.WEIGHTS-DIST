'tar zxvf weights-dist.tar.gz' yields this README.WEIGHTS-DIST file
and 6 subdirectories corresponding to the six ISPs studied in the
paper. Each subdirectory contains two files -- weights.intra and
latencies.intra. Each file contains the backbone topology represented
as a list of edges separated by newlines. The third field in each line
is the corresponding metric -- inferred weight or latency -- of the
edge. The latency estimated is computed by rounding up the geographic
distance to the nearest millisecond.
